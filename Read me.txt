This is a C++ program to calculate some physical quantities in ferromagnetic phase transition of 2D ising model.

The size of the system is given by the parameter you pass from the command line.
For example you can input ./a.out 20 on the command line,
then you create a configuration containing 20*20 spins.

The program contains a for loop for temperature in order to do calculation at various temperature,
but for some quantities such as correlation function,
a few temperature will be enough,
so you can modify the loop scope appropriately when calculating them.

The codes were developed by Yuliang Jin's research group (http://home.itp.ac.cn/~yuliangjin/) 
at Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
